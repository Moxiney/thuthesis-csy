  abstract = {Multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) is currently the most popular transaction management scheme in modern database management systems (DBMSs). Although MVCC was discovered in the late 1970s, it is used in almost every major relational DBMS released in the last decade. Maintaining multiple versions of data potentially increases parallelism without sacrificing serializability when processing transactions. But scaling MVCC in a multi-core and in-memory setting is non-trivial: when there are a large number of threads running in parallel, the synchronization overhead can outweigh the benefits of multi-versioning. To understand how MVCC perform when processing transactions in modern hardware settings, we conduct an extensive study of the scheme's four key design decisions: concurrency control protocol, version storage, garbage collection, and index management. We implemented state-of-the-art variants of all of these in an in-memory DBMS and evaluated them using OLTP workloads. Our analysis identifies the fundamental bottlenecks of each design choice.},

  abstract  = {Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) technologies exhibit 4X the read access latency of conventional DRAM. When the working set does not fit in the processor cache, this latency gap between DRAM and NVM leads to more than 2X runtime increase for queries dominated by latency-bound operations such as index joins and tuple reconstruction. We explain how to easily hide NVM latency by interleaving the execution of parallel work in index joins and tuple reconstruction using coroutines. Our evaluation shows that interleaving applied to the non-trivial implementations of these two operations in a production-grade codebase accelerates end-to-end query runtimes on both NVM and DRAM by up to 1.7X and 2.6X respectively, thereby reducing the performance difference between DRAM and NVM by more than 60\%.},

  abstract  = {Non-volatile memory (NVM) is a new storage technology that combines the performance and byte addressability of DRAM with the persistence of traditional storage devices like flash (SSD). While these properties make NVM highly promising, it is not yet clear how to best integrate NVM into the storage layer of modern database systems. Two system designs have been proposed. The first is to use NVM exclusively, i.e., to store all data and index structures on it. However, because NVM has a higher latency than DRAM, this design can be less efficient than main-memory database systems. For this reason, the second approach uses a page-based DRAM cache in front of NVM. This approach, however, does not utilize the byte addressability of NVM and, as a result, accessing an uncached tuple on NVM requires retrieving an entire page. In this work, we evaluate these two approaches and compare them with in-memory databases as well as more traditional buffer managers that use main memory as a cache in front of SSDs. This allows us to determine how much performance gain can be expected from NVM. We also propose a lightweight storage manager that simultaneously supports DRAM, NVM, and flash. Our design utilizes the byte addressability of NVM and uses it as an additional caching layer that improves performance without losing the benefits from the even faster DRAM and the large capacities of SSDs.},

However, DRAM can be expensive for data center providers, especially given recent global supply shortages that have resulted in increasing DRAM costs. In this work, we design a key-value store, MyNVM, which leverages an NVM block device to reduce DRAM usage, and to reduce the total cost of ownership, while providing comparable latency and queries-per-second (QPS) as MyRocks on a server with a much larger amount of DRAM. Replacing DRAM with NVM introduces several challenges. In particular, NVM has limited read bandwidth, and it wears out quickly under a high write bandwidth.},

  abstract  = {The advent of non-volatile memory (NVM) will fundamentally change the dichotomy between memory and durable storage in database management systems (DBMSs). These new NVM devices are almost as fast as DRAM, but all writes to it are potentially persistent even after power loss. Existing DBMSs are unable to take full advantage of this technology because their internal architectures are predicated on the assumption that memory is volatile. With NVM, many of the components of legacy DBMSs are unnecessary and will degrade the performance of data intensive applications.},

  abstract = {The design of the logging and recovery components of database management systems (DBMSs) has always been inﬂuenced by the difference in the performance characteristics of volatile (DRAM) and non-volatile storage devices (HDD/SSDs). The key assumption has been that non-volatile storage is much slower than DRAM and only supports block-oriented read/writes. But the arrival of new nonvolatile memory (NVM) storage that is almost as fast as DRAM with ﬁne-grained read/writes invalidates these previous design choices. This paper explores the changes that are required in a DBMS to leverage the unique properties of NVM in systems that still include volatile DRAM. We make the case for a new logging and recovery protocol, called write-behind logging, that enables a DBMS to recover nearly instantaneously from system failures. The key idea is that the DBMS logs what parts of the database have changed rather than how it was changed. Using this method, the DBMS ﬂushes the changes to the database before recording them in the log. Our evaluation shows that this protocol improves a DBMS’s transactional throughput by 1.3×, reduces the recovery time by more than two orders of magnitude, and shrinks the storage footprint of the DBMS on NVM by 1.5×. We also demonstrate that our logging protocol is compatible with standard replication schemes.},

  abstract = {Multicore in-memory databases for modern machines can support extraordinarily high transaction rates for online transaction processing workloads. A potential weakness, however, is recovery from crash failures. Can classical techniques, such as checkpoints, be made both efﬁcient enough to keep up with current systems’ memory sizes and transaction rates, and smart enough to avoid additional contention? Starting from an efﬁcient multicore database system, we show that naive logging and checkpoints make normal-case execution slower, but that frequent disk synchronization allows us to keep up with many workloads with only a modest reduction in throughput. We design throughout for parallelism: during logging, during checkpointing, and during recovery. The result is fast. Given appropriate hardware (three SSDs and a RAID), a 32-core system can recover a 43.2 GB key-value database in 106 seconds, and a {\textgreater} 70 GB TPC-C database in 211 seconds.},

  abstract = {Scalable nonvolatile memory DIMMs will finally be commercially available with the release of the Intel Optane DC Persistent Memory Module (or just "Optane DC PMM"). This new nonvolatile DIMM supports byte-granularity accesses with access times on the order of DRAM, while also providing data storage that survives power outages. This work comprises the first in-depth, scholarly, performance review of Intel's Optane DC PMM, exploring its capabilities as a main memory device, and as persistent, byte-addressable memory exposed to user-space applications. This report details the technologies performance under a number of modes and scenarios, and across a wide variety of macro-scale benchmarks. Optane DC PMMs can be used as large memory devices with a DRAM cache to hide their lower bandwidth and higher latency. When used in this Memory (or cached) mode, Optane DC memory has little impact on applications with small memory footprints. Applications with larger memory footprints may experience some slow-down relative to DRAM, but are now able to keep much more data in memory. When used under a file system, Optane DC PMMs can result in significant performance gains, especially when the file system is optimized to use the load/store interface of the Optane DC PMM and the application uses many small, persistent writes. For instance, using the NOVA-relaxed NVMM file system, we can improve the performance of Kyoto Cabinet by almost 2x. Optane DC PMMs can also enable user-space persistence where the application explicitly controls its writes into persistent Optane DC media. In our experiments, modified applications that used user-space Optane DC persistence generally outperformed their file system counterparts. For instance, the persistent version of RocksDB performed almost 2x faster than the equivalent program utilizing an NVMM-aware file system.},
